## Course overview
Information and Communication Technologies for Development (ICTD) meets
Humanitarian Free Open Source Software (HFOSS) in this project-based course.
Students critically analyze how technologies succeed (or fail) across diverse
sociocultural, political, and economic contexts, then engage with HFOSS
communities through code, design, documentation, outreach, or community-defined
contributions that align project needs, student interests, and course learning
outcomes.
