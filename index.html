    <h2>Course Overview</h2>
    <p>
    Information and Communication Technologies for Development (ICTD) meets
    Humanitarian Free Open Source Software (HFOSS) in this project-based course.
    Students critically analyze how technologies succeed (or fail) across
    diverse sociocultural, political, and economic contexts, then engage with
    HFOSS communities through code, design, documentation, outreach, or
    community-defined contributions that align project needs, student
    interests, and course learning outcomes.
    </p>

    <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Analyze technology through ICTD frameworks</li>
      <li>Apply HCI/human-centered design principles</li>
      <li>Contribute to HFOSS projects (code/docs/design/outreach)</li>
      <li>Reflect on open source governance &amp; sustainability</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Texts</h2>
    <p>
    All readings and materials provided via Canvas and/or course GitHub repo.
    No textbook purchase required.
    </p>

    <h2>Assignments Summary</h2>
    <div class="box">
      <p>This course combines ICTD readings and theory with applied work in Humanitarian Free Open Source Software (HFOSS). Assignments are scaffolded to build both conceptual understanding and practical experience with open collaboration. Details below outline expectations, formats, and pacing across the semester.</p>

      <li><strong>Format:</strong>300-500 word submitted on Canvas each Sunday night</li>
      <li><strong>Prompt:</strong> Choose an idea, quote, or argument from the readings that stood out to you. Explain why and connect it to a real example or your HFOSS project. You must engage with all of the assigned readings/materials for the week. You may focus most of your reflection on just 1-2 of them, but make sure you still say something about the others.</li>
      <li>The goal is not to summarize the reading. Please provide your own thoughts on the material. What did you find interesting? Did anything surprise you? Find connections. What does this mean to you?</li>
      <li>Reflections due weekly, Sundays 11:59pm (16 total, lowest dropped)</li>
      <li>After the due date, you'll be able to access a shared document with reading notes for that week (hosted on UNM's OneDrive) to support class discussions and your project development</li>

    <h2>Evaluation and Policies</h2>
    <div class="box">
      <p>Assessment in this course emphasizes consistent engagement, reflection, and thoughtful participation. Grades are based on demonstrated effort, depth of analysis, and contribution to class learning.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Evaluation Criteria</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Effort and Consistency:</strong> Students who keep up with reflections, exercises, and check-ins will find the workload steady and manageable</li>
      <li><strong>Thoughtful Engagement:</strong> High marks go to students who connect course readings to concrete ICTD or HFOSS examples and actively participate in discussion</li>
      <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Collegial, reliable teamwork is essential for the group project and peer review process</li>
      <li><strong>Creativity and Initiative:</strong> Innovative or well-documented attempts/contributions to open source projects are rewarded, even when technical outcomes are modest</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Late Work Policy</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Reading Reflections:</strong> 24-hour grace period for partial credit (up to 80%). No late submissions accepted after grace period.</li>
      <li><strong>HFOSS Exercises and Progress Logs:</strong> 10% penalty per day.</li>
      <li><strong>Group Presentations and Paper</strong> Due dates are firm due to end-of-term scheduling. Extensions are rare and must be approved at least one week in advance.</li>
      <li><strong>Technical Issues:</strong> Students should communicate promptly about GitHub or access problems—technical difficulties are not penalized. Please report issues as soon as you can.</li>
      <li><strong>Extenuating circumstances:</strong> If you run into any issues during the semester, please reach out as soon as possible so we may work out appropriate accommodations and a timeline for making up missed work.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Attendance Policy</h3>
    <p>You are allowed <strong>two unexcused absences</strong>. Absences resulting from conference presentations, job interviews, family emergencies or incapacitating illness are considered excused and do not factor into your two unexcused absences allowance. Make sure you submit appropriate documentation in those cases so that they can be adequately accounted for.</p>

    <h3>Professional Conduct</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Respect for colleagues, classmates, and HFOSS community members is expected at all times.</li>
      <li>Cultural sensitivity, humility, and openness to diverse perspectives are essential values in ICTD and collaborative design work.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Academic Integrity & Collaboration</h2>
    <div class="box">
      <p>This course values collaborative learning and intellectual honesty. Students are encouraged to share knowledge, troubleshoot together, and learn from each other, especially around HFOSS engagement, but all written reflections and graded submissions must be your own work. You may not copy or paraphrase others' writing (including that of peers, online sources, or AI tools) without clear attribution.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Collaboration Guidelines</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Teamwork is central to the group project. You should coordinate clearly on shared deliverables but maintain individual responsibility for your written reflections and logs.</li>
      <li>Seek feedback from classmates or the instructor during class workshops, office hours, or on Canvas discussions.</li>
      <li>Transparency in documenting sources, contributions, and collaborations is essential for fair evaluation.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Use of Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI Tools</h3>
    <p>You may use AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Copilot) to <em>understand readings</em>, <em>brainstorm ideas</em>, or <em>brainstorm structure</em> for your group project, similar to peer collaboration. However, please note the following restrictions:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Reading Reflections:</strong> Must be entirely written by you without AI assistance. These serve as your authentic voice and thinking space.</li>
      <li><strong>Early HFOSS Exercises:</strong> Should be completed independently as much as possible. Please do not use any AI or code-completion tools. Use discussion boards, in-class workshop time, or office hours for support instead.</li>
      <li><strong>Writing for Group Deliverables:</strong> Must be substantially your own. AI may be used to refine clarity or check grammar but cannot create original sections of text, analysis, or argumentation on your behalf.</li>
      <li><strong>Disclosure Requirement:</strong> For every assignment where AI tools are used in any way, include a short note at the end explaining <em>how</em> and <em>why</em> you used it. For example: “I used ChatGPT to outline my main points but wrote all paragraphs and examples myself.”</li>
      <li><strong>Expectation:</strong> During the first half of the semester, please refrain from AI use unless absolutely necessary and always disclose if you do.</li>
      <li><strong>Hallucinations and Fake References:</strong> Please be very careful and double check all references. Using fake or hallucinated references will result in up to a 50% reduction in the corresponding assignment grade.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Failure to disclose AI use or misrepresenting AI-generated content as your own constitutes academic misconduct and may result in grade penalties or university-level disciplinary actions.</em></p>
